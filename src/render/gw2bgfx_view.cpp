///
/// The drawing logic here is the same as tools/viewer/gw2bgfx/viewer.cpp -- the
/// AMAT shader blobs go to bgfx::createShader as stored, the effect's
/// renderState goes into the state word the client would have built, vertex
/// buffers upload without repacking, and the layout is what
/// GrFvf_BuildVertexLayout produces. What is new is the lifetime: the tool owns
/// a process, this owns a window, so resources are created and destroyed per
/// model rather than leaked until exit.
