/// @brief One content object inside a cntc `PackContent`.
///
/// Drives the three-pane content browser: types -> entries -> assets.
///
/// @par Where the fields come from
/// The content type is read from `PackContentIndexEntry[+0]`, **not** from
/// `content + 16`. Measured over all 32549 entries of a live cntc, field 0 has
/// 103 clean distinct values dominated by 35 (Item) and 64 (Skill), whereas
/// `content + 16` has 6573 -- it only coincidentally agrees for some objects.
///
/// @par Why there are two kinds of string
/// An object's strings come from the cntc's own `strings` table via its
/// `PackContentStringIndexFixup` entries, and they are of two kinds. Measured
/// over one live cntc, 21997 strings = 20316 identifier slugs + 1681 readable
/// English labels that are *shared* across objects ("Damage Multiplier" x170).
/// Per-object counts are 0, 1, or 2..144 -- so neither "one string per object"
/// nor "the first string is the name" holds, and in multi-string objects the
/// slug is usually **last**. They must be told apart by shape, not position.
