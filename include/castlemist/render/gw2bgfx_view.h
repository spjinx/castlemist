/// @brief The "Game 1:1" surface -- a second, independent 3D view that draws a
///        model with Guild Wars 2's own shaders through the bgfx the client
///        itself vendors.
///
/// This does not replace castlemist::render. That renderer stays exactly as it
/// was: its own Direct3D 11 device, the map scene, instancing, picking, the
/// gizmo, particles, cloth, the skeleton, LOD selection and its GameShader mode.
/// This surface is a reference view to hold beside it -- same model, drawn the
/// way the client would draw it, so the two can be compared directly.
///
/// It owns a separate bgfx device on its own child window. bgfx is a process
/// singleton, so it is initialised once, lazily, the first time the view is
/// opened, and torn down at shutdown.
///
/// The model is loaded straight out of the archive by MFT index rather than
/// from an already-built ModelPreview, deliberately: the whole point of the view
/// is that nothing between the .dat and the draw call has been reinterpreted.

/// because the exporter needs GW2's real combined shader output as a portable

/// against real captures), where castlemist::render's own DXBC "Shader" mode

///
/// Generates a brand-new, non-overlapping UV layout per material with
/// xatlas (external/xatlas), one shared atlas texture per material combining
/// every geoset that uses it, and rasterizes the real GW2 shader output into
/// that new UV space instead -- the mesh's original uv0 is kept as a real
/// vertex attribute so the shader still samples the source trim sheet
/// correctly; only the OUTPUT position (and therefore where a texel lands in
/// the new atlas) changes. Replaces each affected ModelMeshCPU's vertices
/// (position/normal/tangent preserved, seams duplicated as xatlas requires)
/// and indices with the new atlas-mapped geometry, and each affected
/// material's diffuseTex with the newly baked texture -- unlike
/// bake_model_textures(), this changes exported topology, not just pixels.
/// Materials with no real shader available (see bake_model_textures's own
/// per-material fallback) are left completely untouched: original mesh,
