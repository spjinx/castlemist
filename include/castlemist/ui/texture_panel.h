/// @brief The bottom-right texture panel: what every submesh of the current model
///        is actually textured with.
///
/// A model's material bindings are the one part of a preview you cannot check by
/// looking at the render -- a wrong diffuse and a right diffuse both just look like
/// "a texture". So this panel lists them as data: one group per submesh, and inside
/// it one row per texture that submesh's material references, each with a
/// thumbnail, the dat ids, the pixel size, the source format, the channel layout
/// (R / RG / RGB / RGBA) and the role the material gives it.
///
/// It owns GDI thumbnails built from @ref ModelPreview::textures, so it needs the
/// model only for the duration of the @ref set_model call.

/// so the model may be released afterwards.

/// the pixels, so the host must re-resolve fileId against the current model's
