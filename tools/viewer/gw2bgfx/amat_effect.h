/// @par Why this replaces a heuristic
///
/// An AMAT holds every shader the engine binds for that material across the
/// whole frame -- the deferred normal prepass, depth-only, depth-peel, and the
/// real colour pass. Picking by "which pixel shader has the most samplers", or
/// by scanning for the SH uniform block, gets the right answer often and the
/// wrong answer silently. The engine does not guess: it looks the effect up by
/// a **64-bit token**, with a hardcoded three-link remap chain and a default.
/// That is what is implemented here.
///
/// `shaderPassFlags` is emphatically **not** an opaque/transparent or
/// colour/prepass label -- see ::AmatEffect::shaderPassFlags.
