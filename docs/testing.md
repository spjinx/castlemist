# Testing

Two complementary layers: a unit suite that runs anywhere in under ten seconds,
and headless `GW2_*` hooks in the application itself for the parts that need a
GPU and a window.

## The unit suite

```bash
ctest --preset debug
```

```bash
./build/debug/bin/cm_test_core.exe            # one suite directly
```

```bash
./build/debug/bin/cm_test_core.exe packfile   # filter by "group.name" substring
```

One executable per layer, so a failure names the layer immediately and a
`core` failure can never be caused by a Direct3D device that would not create.

| Suite | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `native` | method-0 round trips: single-symbol input, incompressible input, payloads crossing the CRC framing stride |
| `core` | `Bytes` bounds behaviour, packfile traversal, pointer width, text conversion, env hooks |
| `format` | DDS header and pitch, chat-link decoding, strs framing |
| `db` | The index SQL, on a fixture DB **and** on the real index |
| `extract` | Signature sniffing, content classification, summary parsers, `parallel_for` |
| `render` | Row-vector matrix convention, projection, quaternion pose maths |
| `sim` | Cloth pinning, clamping, and that anchors never drift |
| `media` | Audio/video probe and reject paths |
| `ui` | Control-id uniqueness, timer and message ids, theme brush caching |
| `dat` | End-to-end extraction against a real `Gw2.dat` |

### The framework

`tests/framework/test_framework.h` -- about 200 lines, no dependencies beyond
the standard library. GoogleTest or Catch2 would mean one more checkout under
`external/` for very little.

```cpp
CM_TEST(bytes, u32_is_little_endian) {
    const uint8_t raw[] = {0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12};
    castlemist::core::Bytes b(raw, sizeof raw);
    CHECK_EQ(b.u32(0), 0x12345678u);
}
```

`CHECK`, `CHECK_FALSE`, `CHECK_EQ`, `CHECK_NE`, `CHECK_NEAR`, and `SKIP(reason)`
for a missing fixture. A skipped test is not a failure.

### Tests that need real data

The `dat` suite and two `db` tests open real files and **skip** when they are
absent, so the suite stays green on a machine without a game install.

| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `GW2_TEST_DAT` | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Guild Wars 2\Gw2.dat` |
| `GW2_TEST_INDEX_DB` | `dumps/index/gw2_index.db` |
| `GW2_TEST_TEMPLATE` | `dumps/packfile/gw2_packfile.json` |

Both defaults are found by climbing from `build/<preset>/bin/` to the
repository root, so a normal `ctest --preset debug` picks them up with no setup.

The curated entry ids they assert against are in
`docs/research/curated-test-ids.txt`. They are
**baseIds** (MFT index + 1), not fileIds — mixing the two up is the most common
reason a "known good" id suddenly resolves to something else.

## Headless hooks

Anything needing a device, a window or a sound card is verified by running the
application with an environment variable set, then reading the dump it writes.
The full table is on `castlemist::core::env` in `include/castlemist/core/env.h`; the ones
used most:

```bash
GW2_AUTOLOAD=291977 ./build/debug/bin/castlemist.exe
```

Add `GW2_GAMESHOT=1` to also write `shot_game11.bmp` from the "Game 1:1" bgfx
view; `GW2_ORBIT=yaw,pitch` (radians) turns both views the same way.

Others, same shape: `GW2_GIZMOTEST=1` exercises gizmo hit-testing,
`GW2_CLOTHTEST=1` dumps rest/draped/wind BMPs, `GW2_SCENE=181140
GW2_SCENEGAME=1` loads a map with the game's own shaders, `GW2_AUDIOTEST=2861`
probes and plays an entry into `audiotest.txt`, and
`GW2_PARSETEST=118599,119671` runs the summary parsers into `parsetest.txt`.

Lighting and tone-mapping knobs (`GW2_LIGHT`, `GW2_POSTEXP`, `GW2_POSTGAMMA`,
`GW2_AUTOEXP`, ...) are for eyeballing a change, not for assertions.

## Adding a test

1. Put it in the suite for the layer that owns the behaviour.
2. If it needs a layer's internal header (`internal.h`, `detail/state.h`,
   `detail/app_state.h`), add the layer to that test's `PRIVATE_HEADERS` in
   `tests/CMakeLists.txt` -- it is already set up for `extract`, `render` and `ui`.
3. Prefer a synthetic fixture built in the test to a captured blob: the
   interesting cases (a 64-bit-pointer packfile, a truncated array, a chunk
   whose declared size runs past the buffer) are hard to find in real data and
   trivial to write by hand.
4. Say **why** in a comment when the assertion encodes a fact about GW2 rather
   than about the code. "Reading a 64-bit blob as 32-bit yields zero-length
   arrays instead of an error" is the reason that test exists.
